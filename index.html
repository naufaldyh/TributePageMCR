        My Chemical Romance (commonly acronymized to MCR or abbreviated to My
        Chem) is an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey. The band's
        current lineup consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro
        and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro,
        and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed to
        Eyeball Records and released their debut album, I Brought You My
        Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise
        Records the next year and released their major-label debut, Three Cheers
        for Sweet Revenge, in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier
        was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded
        platinum status over a year later.
